# Adding a :simple-materialformkdocs: badge to your project

__You enjoy working with Material for MkDocs? Share the love! You can now add
a badge to your project's README, showing that your project is built with
Material for MkDocs.__

Material for MkDocs' logo was just added to [Simple Icons], which is used by
[Shields.io] to include logos in badges. We generated a badge for you, which
you can add to your project's README:

[![Material for MkDocs][badge]](#usage)

## Usage
