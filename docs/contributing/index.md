# Contributing

Material for MkDocs is an actively maintained and constantly improved project 
that serves a diverse user base with varying backgrounds and needs. In order to 
effectively address the needs of all our users, evaluate requests, and fix bugs, 
we maintainers need to put in a lot of work.

Our community is pretty big and includes many active users who open new 
discussions or issues multiple times a day, filling the [issue tracker] or the 
[discussion board] with a lot of valuable knowledge. As such, we consider our 
issue tracker and discussion board to be a knowledge base that is an important 
addition to our [documentation], and brings value to both new and experienced 
users of Material for MkDocs. 

## How to contribute

We've invested time and effort into making our [issue tracker] and [discussion board] 
as user-friendly as possible. We understand that reporting bugs, 
requesting features, and engaging with our community can be challenging, so 
we've optimized our templates and added guidelines to improve all overall 
interaction within this project.

Our goal is to ensure that our platform is __well-structured__, __easy to navigate__, 
and __searchable__, so you can find what you need quickly and efficiently. We've 
also optimized our templates to help us understand your needs better, so we can 
provide you with faster and more effective support. In this documentation 
section, we'll give you an overview of each process and guide you to the
detailed subpages.

## Before contributing

Before interacting within this project, please take a moment to consider the 
following questions. By doing so, you can ensure that you are using the correct 
issue template or provide all necessary information when interacting with the 
community:

### Before submitting an issue, review:

- Am I using the right issue template for my [request], [report], or [contribution]?           
- Have I checked if a similar issue or request has already been submitted?
- Did I fill out every field as requested?
- Did I provide all additional information others might need to comprehend my request?

 [request]: https://github.com/squidfunk/mkdocs-material/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=03-request-a-change.yml

 [contribution]: https://github.com/squidfunk/mkdocs-material/issues/new?assignees=&labels=change+request&template=04-add-a-translation.yml&title=Add+translations+for+...

### Before asking a question, reconsider:

- Is there an open discussion on the topic of my request?
- Does my question fit the direction of the discussion, or should I open a new discussion?
- Is my topic a question for the discussion boards, or is it a bug report or idea request that requires a new issue?
- Did I provide the community with all the necessary information to comprehend my question?
- Have I checked if my question has been answered before?

### Before leaving a comment, rethink:

- Is my comment directly related to the topic of this page, e.g., blog post or discussion?
- Is it a comment or a request?
- Should I use the discussion board for my request or comment instead?
- Does my comment add value to the conversation?
- Is my comment respectful and constructive?
