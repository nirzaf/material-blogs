# Adding a git repository

If your documentation is related to source code, Material for MkDocs provides
the ability to display information to the project's repository as part of the
static site, including stars and forks. Furthermore, the
[date of last update and creation], as well as [contributors] can be shown.

## Configuration

### Repository

[:octicons-tag-24: 0.1.0][repo_url support] ·
:octicons-milestone-24: Default: _none_

In order to display a link to the repository of your project as part of your
documentation, set [`repo_url`][repo_url] in `mkdocs.yml` to the public URL of
your repository, e.g.:

``` yaml
repo_url: https://github.com/squidfunk/mkdocs-material
```

The link to the repository will be rendered next to the search bar on big
screens and as part of the main navigation drawer on smaller screen sizes.
Additionally, for public repositories hosted on [GitHub] or [GitLab], the
number of stars and forks is automatically requested and rendered.

GitHub repositories also include the tag of the latest release.[^1]

  [^1]:
    Unfortunately, GitHub only provides an API endpoint to obtain the [latest
    release] - not the latest tag. Thus, make sure to [create a release] (not 
    pre-release) for the latest tag you want to display next to the number of
    stars and forks.

  [create a release]: https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/releasing-projects-on-github/managing-releases-in-a-repository#creating-a-release

#### Repository name

[:octicons-tag-24: 0.1.0][repo_name support] ·
:octicons-milestone-24: Default: _automatically set to_ `GitHub`, `GitLab` _or_
`Bitbucket`

MkDocs will infer the source provider by examining the URL and try to set the
_repository name_ automatically. If you wish to customize the name, set
[`repo_name`][repo_name] in `mkdocs.yml`:

``` yaml
repo_name: squidfunk/mkdocs-material
```

  [repo_name support]: https://github.com/squidfunk/mkdocs-material/releases/tag/0.1.0
  [repo_name]: https://www.mkdocs.org/user-guide/configuration/#repo_name

#### Repository icon

[:octicons-tag-24: 5.0.0][icon.repo support] ·
:octicons-milestone-24: Default:
[`fontawesome/brands/git-alt`][icon.repo default]

While the default repository icon is a generic git icon, it can be set to
any icon bundled with the theme by referencing a valid icon path in
`mkdocs.yml`:

``` yaml
theme:
  icon:
    repo: fontawesome/brands/git-alt # (1)!
```

1.  Enter a few keywords to find the perfect icon using our [icon search] and
    click on the shortcode to copy it to your clipboard:

    <div class="mdx-iconsearch" data-mdx-component="iconsearch">
      <input class="md-input md-input--stretch mdx-iconsearch__input" placeholder="Search icon" data-mdx-component="iconsearch-query" value="git" />
      <div class="mdx-iconsearch-result" data-mdx-component="iconsearch-result" data-mdx-mode="file">
        <div class="mdx-iconsearch-result__meta"></div>
        <ol class="mdx-iconsearch-result__list"></ol>
      </div>
    </div>

Some popular choices:

- :fontawesome-brands-git: – `fontawesome/brands/git`
- :fontawesome-brands-git-alt: – `fontawesome/brands/git-alt`
- :fontawesome-brands-git-square: – `fontawesome/brands/git-square`
- :fontawesome-brands-github: – `fontawesome/brands/github`
- :fontawesome-brands-github-alt: – `fontawesome/brands/github-alt`
- :fontawesome-brands-github-square: – `fontawesome/brands/github-square`
- :fontawesome-brands-gitlab: – `fontawesome/brands/gitlab`
- :fontawesome-brands-gitkraken: – `fontawesome/brands/gitkraken`
- :fontawesome-brands-bitbucket: – `fontawesome/brands/bitbucket`
- :fontawesome-solid-trash: – `fontawesome/solid/trash`

#### Edit button

[:octicons-tag-24: 0.1.0][edit_uri support] ·
:octicons-milestone-24: Default: _automatically set_

If the repository URL points to a [GitHub], [GitLab] or [Bitbucket] repository,
an edit button is displayed at the top of each document. This behavior can be
changed by setting [`edit_uri`][edit_uri] in `mkdocs.yml`:

=== "Customize edit path"

    ``` yaml
    edit_uri: edit/master/docs/
    ```

=== "Hide edit button"

    ``` yaml
    edit_uri: ""
    ```

### Revisioning

The following plugins are fully integrated with Material for MkDocs, allowing
for showing the [date of last update and creation] of a document, as well as
links to all [contributors] or [authors] involved.

  [date of last update and creation]: #document-dates
  [contributors]: #document-contributors
  [authors]: #document-authors

#### Document dates

[:octicons-tag-24: 4.6.0][git-revision-date-localized support] ·
[:octicons-cpu-24: Plugin][git-revision-date-localized]

The [git-revision-date-localized] plugin adds support for adding the date of
last update and creation of a document at the bottom of each page. Install it
with `pip`:

```
pip install mkdocs-git-revision-date-localized-plugin
```

Then, add the following lines to `mkdocs.yml`:

``` yaml
plugins:
  - git-revision-date-localized:
      enable_creation_date: true
```

The following configuration options are supported:

`type`{ #type }

:   :octicons-milestone-24: Default: `date` – The format of the date to be
    displayed. Valid values are `date`, `datetime`, `iso_date`, `iso_datetime`
    and `timeago`:

    ``` yaml
    plugins:
      - git-revision-date-localized:
          type: date
    ```

`enable_creation_date`{ #enable-creation-date }

:   [:octicons-tag-24: 7.1.4][enable_creation_date support] ·
    :octicons-milestone-24: Default: `false` – Enables the display of the
    creation date of the file associated with the page next to the last updated
    date at the bottom of the page:

    ``` yaml
    plugins:
      - git-revision-date-localized:
          enable_creation_date: true
    ```

`fallback_to_build_date`{ #fallback-to-build-date }

:   :octicons-milestone-24: Default: `false` – Enables falling back to
    the time when `mkdocs build` was executed. Can be used as a fallback when
    the build is performed outside of a git repository:

    ``` yaml
    plugins:
      - git-revision-date-localized:
          fallback_to_build_date: true
    ```

The other configuration options of this extension are not officially supported
by Material for MkDocs, which is why they may yield unexpected results. Use
them at your own risk.

[:octicons-tag-24: insiders-4.19.0][Insiders] ·
[:octicons-cpu-24: Plugin][git-committers] ·
:octicons-beaker-24: Experimental

The [git-committers][^2] plugin renders the GitHub avatars of all contributors,
linking to their GitHub profiles at the bottom of each page. As always, it can
be installed with `pip`:

  [^2]:
    We currently recommend using a fork of the [git-committers] plugin, as it
    contains many improvements that have not yet been merged back into the
    original plugin. See byrnereese/mkdocs-git-committers-plugin#12 for more
    information.

```
pip install mkdocs-git-committers-plugin-2
```

Then, add the following lines to `mkdocs.yml`:

``` yaml
plugins:
  - git-committers:
      repository: squidfunk/mkdocs-material
      token: !ENV GH_TOKEN
```

The following configuration options are supported:

`repository`{ #committers-repository }

:   :octicons-milestone-24: Default: _none_ · :octicons-alert-24: Required –
    This property must be set to the slug of the repository that contains your
    documentation. The slug must follow the pattern `<username>/<repository>`:

    ``` yaml
    plugins:
      - git-committers:
          repository: squidfunk/mkdocs-material
    ```

`token`{ #committers-repository }

:   :octicons-milestone-24: Default: _none_ – This property should[^3] be set to
    a [personal access token], which is used by the plugin to query GitHub's API
    for document contributor information:

      [^3]:
        Setting a [personal access token] is not required, but recommended, as
        GitHub has very low [rate limits] on their APIs that you'll probably run
        into. When using a token, [rate limits] are much higher.

    ``` yaml
    plugins:
      - git-committers:
          token: !ENV GH_TOKEN
    ```

The other configuration options of this extension are not officially supported
by Material for MkDocs, which is why they may yield unexpected results. Use
them at your own risk.

The [git-authors] plugin extracts the authors of a document from git to display
them at the bottom of each page. It's a lightweight alternative to the
[git-committers] plugin. Install it with `pip`:

```
pip install mkdocs-git-authors-plugin
```

Then, add the following lines to `mkdocs.yml`:

``` yaml
plugins:
  - git-authors
```
