# Meta tags

In HTML, `meta` tags allow to provide additional metadata for a document, e.g.
page titles and descriptions, additional assets to be loaded, and [Open Graph]
metadata. While arbitrary `meta` tags can always be added via [customization],
some common `meta` tags can be configured.

  [Open Graph]: https://ogp.me/
  [customization]: #customization

## Configuration

This configuration adds support for setting custom page titles and descriptions
in [front matter], as well as for using custom metadata in templates. Add the
following lines to `mkdocs.yml`:

``` yaml
markdown_extensions:
  - meta
```

See additional configuration options:

- [Metadata]

  [front matter]: https://jekyllrb.com/docs/front-matter/
  [Metadata]: ../setup/extensions/python-markdown.md#metadata

## Usage

### Setting the page title

When [Metadata] is enabled, the page title can be overridden for a document with
some custom front matter. Add the following lines at the top of a Markdown file:

``` bash
---
title: Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet # (1)
---

# Document title
...
```

1.  This will set the [`title`][title] inside the HTML document's [`head`][head]
    for the generated page to this value. Note that the site title, which is set
    via [`site_name`][site_name], is appended with a dash.

  [title]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/title
  [head]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/head
  [site_name]: https://www.mkdocs.org/user-guide/configuration/#site_name

### Setting the page description

When [Metadata] is enabled, the page description can be overridden for a
document with custom front matter. Add the following lines at the top of a
Markdown file:

``` bash
---
description: Nullam urna elit, malesuada eget finibus ut, ac tortor.
---

# Document title
...
```

This will set the `meta` tag containing the site description inside the
document `head` for the current page to the provided value.

### Adding a web app manifest

[:octicons-tag-24: 3.1.0][manifest support] ·
:octicons-archive-24: Deprecated ·
:octicons-trash-24: 8.0.0

A [web app manifest] is a simple JSON file that specifies how your web
application should behave when installed on the user's mobile device or desktop,
which can be set via `mkdocs.yml`:

``` yaml
extra:
  manifest: manifest.webmanifest # (1)
```

1.  This option was deprecated, as it's not widely used and the same behavior
    can be achieved with [theme extension].

  [web app manifest]: https://web.dev/add-manifest/
  [manifest support]: https://github.com/squidfunk/mkdocs-material/releases/tag/3.1.0
  [theme extension]: ../customization.md#extending-the-theme

</div>

## Customization

### Using metadata in templates

#### on all pages

In order to add custom `meta` tags to your document, you can [extend the theme
][theme extension] and [override the `extrahead` block][overriding blocks],
e.g. to add indexing policies for search engines via the `robots` property:

``` html
{% extends "base.html" %}

{% block extrahead %}
  <meta property="robots" content="noindex, nofollow" />
{% endblock %}
```

  [overriding blocks]: ../customization.md#overriding-blocks

#### on a single page

If you want to set a `meta` tag on a single page, or want to set different
values for different pages, you can use the `page.meta` object inside your
template override, e.g.:

``` html
{% extends "base.html" %}

{% block extrahead %}
  {% if page and page.meta and page.meta.robots %}
    <meta property="robots" content="{{ page.meta.robots }}" />
  {% else %}
    <meta property="robots" content="index, follow" />
  {% endif %}
{% endblock %}
```

You can now use `robots` exactly like [`title`][title] and
[`description`][description] to set values. Note that in this case, the
template defines an `else` branch, which would set a default if none was given.

  [description]: #setting-the-page-description
