# Meta tags

TBD

<!-- Material for MkDocs supports several flavors of lists that cater to different
use cases, including _unordered lists_ and _ordered lists_, which are supported
through standard Markdown, as well as _definition lists_ and _task lists_, which
are supported through extensions. -->

## Configuration

### Metadata

[:octicons-file-code-24: Source][1] Â· [:octicons-workflow-24: Extension][2]

The [Metadata][1] extension, which is part of the standard Markdown
library, adds the ability to add custom metadata to a document and can be 
enabled from `mkdocs.yml`:

``` yaml
markdown_extensions:
  - meta
```

## Customization

- add custom meta tags, like twitter cards etc via customization!?
