# Math

[MathJax] and [KaTeX] are two popular libraries for displaying 
mathematical content in browsers. Although both libraries offer similar 
functionality, they use different syntaxes and have different configuration 
options. This documentation site provides information on how to integrate them 
with Material for MkDocs easily.

  [MathJax]: https://www.mathjax.org/
  [LaTeX]: https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Mathematics
  [MathML]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MathML
  [AsciiMath]: http://asciimath.org/
  [KaTeX]: https://katex.org/


## Configuration

The following configuration enables support for rendering block and 
inline block equations using [MathJax] and [KaTeX].

### MathJax

[MathJax] is a powerful and flexible library that supports multiple input formats, 
such as [LaTeX], [MathML], [AsciiMath], as well as various output formats like 
HTML, SVG, MathML. To use MathJax within your project, add the following lines 
to your `mkdocs.yml`.

=== ":octicons-file-code-16: `docs/javascripts/mathjax.js`"

    ``` js
    window.MathJax = {
      tex: {
        inlineMath: [["\\(", "\\)"]],
        displayMath: [["\\[", "\\]"]],
        processEscapes: true,
        processEnvironments: true
      },
      options: {
        ignoreHtmlClass: ".*|",
        processHtmlClass: "arithmatex"
      }
    };

    document$.subscribe(() => { // (1)!
      MathJax.typesetPromise()
    })
    ```

    1. This integrates MathJax with [instant loading].

=== ":octicons-file-code-16: `mkdocs.yml`"

    ``` yaml
    markdown_extensions:
      - pymdownx.arithmatex:
          generic: true

    extra_javascript:
      - javascripts/mathjax.js
      - https://polyfill.io/v3/polyfill.min.js?features=es6
      - https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/mathjax@3/es5/tex-mml-chtml.js
    ```

See additional configuration options:

- [Arithmatex]

  [Arithmatex]: ../setup/extensions/python-markdown-extensions.md#arithmatex
  [instant loading]: ../setup/setting-up-navigation.md#instant-loading


### KaTeX

[KaTeX] is a lightweight library that focuses on speed and simplicity. It 
supports a subset of LaTeX syntax and can render math to HTML and SVG. To use 
[KaTeX] within your project, add the following lines to your `mkdocs.yml`.

=== ":octicons-file-code-16: `docs/javascripts/katex.js`"

    ``` js
    document$.subscribe(({ body }) => { // (1)!
      renderMathInElement(body, {
        delimiters: [
          { left: "$$",  right: "$$",  display: true },
          { left: "$",   right: "$",   display: false },
          { left: "\\(", right: "\\)", display: false },
          { left: "\\[", right: "\\]", display: true }
        ],
      })
    })
    ```

    1. This integrates KaTeX with [instant loading].

=== ":octicons-file-code-16: `mkdocs.yml`"

    ``` yaml
    extra_javascript:
      - javascripts/katex.js 
      - https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/KaTeX/0.16.7/katex.min.js  # (1)!
      - https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/KaTeX/0.16.7/contrib/auto-render.min.js
    
    extra_css:
      - https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/KaTeX/0.16.7/katex.min.css
    ```

    1.  Alternatively, you can add these JavaScript and CSS files via `script` tags by overriding HTML files.


<script src="https://polyfill.io/v3/polyfill.min.js?features=es6"></script>
<script id="MathJax-script" async src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/mathjax@3/es5/tex-mml-chtml.js"></script>
<script>
  window.MathJax = {
    tex: {
      inlineMath: [["\\(", "\\)"]],
      displayMath: [["\\[", "\\]"]],
      processEscapes: true,
      processEnvironments: true
    },
    options: {
      ignoreHtmlClass: ".*|",
      processHtmlClass: "arithmatex"
    }
  };
</script>


## Usage

### Using block syntax

Blocks must be enclosed in `#!latex $$...$$` or `#!latex \[...\]` on separate
lines:

``` latex title="block syntax"
$$
\operatorname{ker} f=\{g\in G:f(g)=e_{H}\}{\mbox{.}}
$$
```

<div class="result" markdown>

$$
\operatorname{ker} f=\{g\in G:f(g)=e_{H}\}{\mbox{.}}
$$

</div>

### Using inline block syntax

Inline blocks must be enclosed in `#!latex $...$` or `#!latex \(...\)`:

``` latex title="inline syntax"
The homomorphism $f$ is injective if and only if its kernel is only the 
singleton set $e_G$, because otherwise $\exists a,b\in G$ with $a\neq b$ such 
that $f(a)=f(b)$.
```

<div class="result" markdown>

The homomorphism $f$ is injective if and only if its kernel is only the 
singleton set $e_G$, because otherwise $\exists a,b\in G$ with $a\neq b$ such 
that $f(a)=f(b)$.

</div>


## Comparing MathJax and KaTeX

When deciding between MathJax and KaTeX, there are several key factors to 
consider:

- __Speed__: KaTeX is generally faster than MathJax. If your site requires rendering large 
quantities of complex equations quickly, KaTeX may be the better choice.

- __Syntax Support__: MathJax supports a wider array of LaTeX commands and can 
process a variety of mathematical markup languages (like AsciiMath and MathML). 
If you need advanced LaTeX features, MathJax may be more suitable.

- __Output Format__: Both libraries support HTML and SVG outputs. However, 
MathJax also offers MathML output, which can be essential for accessibility, as 
it is readable by screen readers.

- __Configurability__: MathJax provides a range of configuration options, 
allowing for more precise control over its behavior. If you have specific 
rendering requirements, MathJax might be a more flexible choice.

- __Browser Support__: While both libraries work well in modern browsers, 
MathJax has broader compatibility with older browsers. If your audience uses a 
variety of browsers, including older ones, MathJax might be a safer option.

In summary, KaTeX shines with its speed and simplicity, whereas MathJax offers 
more features and better compatibility at the expense of speed. The choice 
between the two will largely depend on your specific needs and constraints.
