# Material for MkDocs

## Beautiful documentation

You're currently looking at a full responsive [MkDocs][] theme in the spirit of
Google's [material design][] guidelines. MkDocs is an excellent static site
documentation generator that is meant for building good looking project
documentation.

This theme is **optimized for all sorts of devices** and is built from scratch
without any bloated Javascript or CSS Frameworks with **only 24kb of JS and
CSS** (minified, gzipped and excluding Google WebFonts and Analytics). Yet, it
is highly customizable in terms of fonts, colors and gracefully supports older
browsers.

## Features

- Beautiful, readable and very user-friendly design based on Google's
  **material design** guidelines, packed in a **full responsive** template
  with a well-defined color palette, great typography, as well as a beautiful
  search interface and footer.

- Well-tested and **optimized CSS and Javascript**, including a cross-browser
  fixed/sticky header, a drawer that even works without Javascript using
  the `:checked` hack with fallbacks, **responsive tables** that scroll when
  the screen is too small and **well-defined print styles**.

- Extra configuration options like **project logo**, links to the authors
  **GitHub and Twitter accounts** and display of the **amount of stars** the
  project has on GitHub.

- **Easily extendable and customizable** due to a well-designed asset pipeline
  built on-top of [Gulp][] with `npm` and `bower` and modular and abstracted
  style definitions built with [SASS][].

- **Web application capability** on iOS - when the page is saved to the
  homescreen, it behaves and looks like a native application.

See the [getting started guide](getting-started.md) for instructions how to get
it up and running.
