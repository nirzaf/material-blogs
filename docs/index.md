# Material <small>for MkDocs</small>

## Build beautiful documentation

Material is a theme for [MkDocs][1], an excellent static site generator geared
towards project documentation. It is built using Google's [Material Design][2]
guidelines, fully responsive and optimized for touch and pointer devices.

Material is very lightweight – it is built from scratch using Javascript and
CSS that weighs approximately 30kb (minified, gzipped and excluding Google
Fonts and Analytics). Yet, it is highly customizable and degrades gracefully in
older browsers.
