# Minification 

The [mkdocs-minify-plugin][1] will minify all `*.html` files generated by
`mkdocs build` in a post-processing step, stripping all unnecessary characters
to reduce the payload served to the client.

## Installation

Install the plugin using `pip`:

``` sh
pip install mkdocs-minify-plugin
```

## Usage

Add the following lines to `mkdocs.yml`:

``` yaml
plugins:
  - search
  - minify:
      minify_html: true
```

!!! warning "Remember to re-add the `search` plugin"

    If you have no `plugins` entry in your config file yet, you'll likely also
    want to add back the `search` plugin. MkDocs enables it by default if there
    is no `plugins` entry set and it will not be included if omitted.
